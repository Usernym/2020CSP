	    <h2 id= "Font" font-size: 20px > Draw it Yourself </h2>
		<p> This project guides the user through a series of steps to draw their own image with an under the sea theme. The program asks the user specific questions pertaining to object and the program responds based on their answer. After the user selects an object to draw, the following questions would be more detailed, gathering information about the user’s preference of color, size, position of that specific object. This process repeats for every object in the program until the user responds no to the question "would you like to draw?"

	    <h2 id= "Font" font-size: 20px > A Turtle Eating Apples</h2>
	    <p> We first import the turtle and the random module. Then we establish the screen’s background color, the pensize and pen color, along with the turtle shape and its initial size. After this, we set up a red circle to be the "apple" in our game. The turtle moves around the screen controlled by arrow keys to eat randomly generated apples, as the name suggests, before the time runs out. The score in the upper right corner increases by one for every apple eaten and the timer, found in the upper left corner, runs for a total of 30 seconds. For every apple eaten, the turtle grows and the turtle’s trail changes its color. When the timer runs out, the game ends.
